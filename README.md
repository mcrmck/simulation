## Statement 

One of the following is true:
1. The human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a "posthuman" stage
2. Any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof)
3. We are almost certainly living in a simulation
